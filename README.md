## Description

Social Network API is a server-side application that allows users to create thoughts, react to thoughts, and add and delete friends. My passion for backend development inspired me to build this application.

In creating Social Network API, I learned a lot about using MongoDB to establish a NoSQL database, Node and Express for server-side logic and API development, and moment for formatting dates in the database on query.

Social Network API can be used as the foundation for a social media web application. Below is a link to a live demo on how to actually run the application and test its routes using Insomnia
